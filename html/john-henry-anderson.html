                        <p>John Henry Anderson was born on July 14, 1814 in Craigmile, Aberdeen, Scotland, in the family of a farmer. His mother was Mary Robertson. He orphaned early and from 1824 had to work as a blacksmith assistant.</p>
                        <p>In 1830 he joined a troupe of the wandering theater as an ancillary worker and left with them on a tour. Gradually, he mastered acting skills and began to take part in performances. While trying to show tricks he understood that magic is his calling.</p>
                        <p>Soon Anderson buys necessary props and begins his independent performances as an illusionist. In 1837, inspired by success, he created a great illusion program and, under the pseudonym "The Great Caledonian Conjuror", toured the whole country. Presumably, in these years, he begins to show his trick "Rabbit in a Hat", where he combined an illusionary performance with an actor's play on stage.</p>
                        <p>In 1840 he decides to move his performances to the theater hall. For this purpose Anderson opens a special "New Strand Theatre" in London. He changes his stage name to “The Great Wizard of the North” and invents his own equipment to give unprecedented performances. Anderson believed that the main thing in the performance is entertainment. If the viewer was not satisfied by John's performance, the numbers were immediately replaced with more interesting ones. Although the conjurer did not invent tricks himself, his artistic play contributed much to the popularization of the art of the illusion.</p>
                        <p>In 1842, Anderson married Hannah Longherst of Aberdeen. The following year, John Henry Jr. was born. In 1845, Anderson's mistress gave birth to Philip, but died during the parturition. Anderson accepted the child and supported him until the end of his days. He had two more daughters, Alice and Elena, and also a son Oscar. All of his children, his wife and both lovers actively participated in the performances.</p>
                        <p>Another Anderson’s Theater was opened in Glasgow in 1845. Only four months after the opening, the theater burned to the ground. The financial losses were significant, but thanks to the insurance and the help of his friends, Anderson was able to begin preparations for a new performance at London's Covent Garden Theater. The premiere took place in 1846. A year later he visited Europe. He gave performances in Hamburg, Stockholm and St. Petersburg.</p>
                        <p>In 1849 Anderson returned to London to give a special performance to Queen Victoria. That was the time when Anderson discovered that he has a competitor - <a href="jean-robert-houdin.html">Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin</a> - a French illusionist. In 1851 he makes three-year tours to America, Canada, Australia and the Hawaiian Islands. There, for the first time, he shows his trick "Catching the bullet."</p>
                        <p>In 1854, John decided to leave the stage and give a farewell performance in his homeland in Aberdeen. The success was so great that it changed all Anderson's plans. He continues to give many successful performances, slowly transforming into a denunciator of spiritism. In a new show he uses his daughters to create all sorts of "mysterious" effects.</p>
                        <p>On March 5, 1856 rented building of the royal theater Covent Garden suddenly was caught on fire. It was Anderson’s second time in his career when he lost all his fortune and became a bankrupt.</p>
                        <p>After a short break, in 1859 he begins a new world tour, and in 1862 his son John Henry Jr., goes on his separate illusive tour. Anderson took the incident very seriously and spent many years at odds with his son.</p>
                        <p>In 1864, Anderson returned to England. Things were not going well and debts were growing. He took his last major tour in 1866.</p>
                        <p>On February 5, 1874, in Darlington, Durham, United Kingdom, John Henry Anderson passed away. His body was transported to his homeland in Scotland, where he was buried next to his mother in the cemetery of St Nicholas in Aberdeen.</p>
                        <p>The famous illusionist <a href="harry-houdini.html">Harry Houdini</a> visited the grave of John Henry Anderson in 1909 and found it in utter desolation. Houdini always revered Anderson and considered him as an inspiration and even established a special fund for the maintenance and care for the last resort of the “Great Wizard of the North”</p>
