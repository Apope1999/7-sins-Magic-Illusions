                <h1>Resurgance of Magic</h1>
                <h2>1500s -1600s</h2>
                <p>During the later half of the 15th century magic as a performance art seems to make a comeback. It accomplishes it through the publication of certain books. One of the first of those books being The Discoverie of Witchcraft, a book designed in part to counter the activities of persecutionists, but at the same time revealing many conjuring secrets of the day. Magic and witchcraft were still linked, and many copies of Scot's book were burnt in the early 17th century. </p>
                <div class="row align-items-center spacing" >
                    <div class="col">
                        <p> The Discoverie of Witchcraft was a book written by Reginald Scot, a justice of the peace in Kent, England, first published in London, during 1584. Subtitled: Proving that the compacts and contracts of witches with devils and all infernal spirits or familiars, are but erroneous novelties and imaginary conceptions.
                            The book was an expos√© of medieval witchcraft, which at the time was sweeping continental Europe and Scotland, making its way to England.
                            A small portion was devoted to the performance magic and was plagiarized heavily.Along with a well researched study on the practice of witchcraft, it also touched on astrology, alchemy, and divination. It presented logical evidences against the existence of witches.
                            The sections on magic follows several chapters discussing the similarities between the claims of Pharaoh's magicians, false prophets, and "our witches", and how they all use "juggling knacks" to convince others of their powers. </p>

                <h2>1700s to early 1800s</h2>
                <p>During the 17th century, many similar books were published that described in detail the methods of a number of magic tricks, including The Art of Conjuring (1614) and The Anatomy of Legerdemain: The Art of Juggling (c.1675).</p>

                <p>Until the 18th century, magic shows were a common source of entertainment at fairs, where itinerant performers would entertain the public with magic tricks, as well as the more traditional spectacles of sword swallowing, juggling and fire breathing. In the early 18th century, as belief in witchcraft was waning, the art became increasingly respectable and shows would be put on for rich private patrons.

                        <p>A notable figure in this transition was the English showman, <a href="">Isaac Fawkes</a>, who began to promote his act in advertisements from the 1720s ‚Äì he even claimed to have performed for King George II. One of Fawkes' advertisements described his routine in some detail:</p>
                        <p>He takes an empty bag, lays it on the Table and turns it several times inside out, then commands 100 Eggs out of it and several showers of real Gold and silver, then the Bag beginning to swell several sorts of wild fowl run out of it upon the Table. He throws up a Pack of Cards, and causes them to be living birds flying about the room. He causes living Beasts, Birds, and other Creatures to appear upon the Table. He blows the spots of the Cards off and on, and changes them to any pictures.[7]

                        <p>The Turk, (Mechanical Turk or Automaton Chess Player) was a chess-playing machine constructed in the late 18th century, and exhibited from 1770 for over 84 years, by various owners, as an automaton. Constructed and unveiled in 1770 by Wolfgang von Kempelen (1734‚Äì1804) to impress the Empress Maria Theresa</p>
                        <p>Publicly promoted as an automaton and given its common name based on its appearance, the Turk was in fact a mechanical illusion that allowed a human chess master hiding inside to operate the machine. With a skilled operator, the Turk won most of the games played during its demonstrations around Europe and the Americas</p>

                <h1>The birth of modern stage magic</h1>
                <p>A founding figure of modern entertainment magic was <a href="">Jean Eug√®ne Robert-Houdin</a>, originally a clockmaker, who opened a magic theatre in Paris in 1845. He transformed his art from one performed at fairs to a performance that the public paid to see at the theatre. His speciality was constructing mechanical automata that appeared to move and act as if alive. Many of Robert-Houdin's mechanisms for illusion were pirated by his assistant and ended up in the performances of his rivals, John Henry Anderson and Alexander Herrmann.</p>

                <p> <a href="">John Henry Anderson</a> was pioneering the same transition in London. In 1840 he opened the New Strand Theatre, where he performed as The Great Wizard of the North. His success came from advertising his shows and captivating his audience with expert showmanship. He became one of the earliest magicians to attain a high level of world renown. He opened a second theatre in Glasgow in 1845.</p>

                        <p>Towards the end of the century, large magic shows permanently staged at big theatre venues became the norm. The British performer J N Maskelyne and his partner Cooke were established at the Egyptian Hall in London's Piccadilly in 1873 by their manager William Morton, and continued there for 31 years. The show incorporated stage illusions and reinvented traditional tricks with exotic (often Oriental) imagery. The potential of the stage was exploited for hidden mechanisms and assistants, and the control it offers over the audience's point of view. Maskelyne and Cooke invented many of the illusions still performed today ‚Äì one of his best-known being levitation.</p>

                        <p>Modern Magic by Professor Hoffmann (real name Angelo Lewis) is a treatise in book form, first published in 1876, detailing the apparatus, methods and tricks used by the magicians and conjurors of that era. Hoffmann was considered to be one of the greatest authorities on the theory and practice of magic, despite his own limited professional experience as a magician.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Professor Hoffman imparted much of his wisdom and expertise in the art of magic through a series of four books: Modern Magic, More Magic (1890), Later Magic (1903), Latest Magic</p>
                </div>
                <p>Of the series, Modern Magic is best known. The book contains advice on the appearance, the dress and the staging of a magician. It then goes on to describe many tricks with playing cards, coins, watches, rings, handkerchiefs, dominoes, dice, cups and balls, balls, and hats, and concludes with a long chapter of miscellaneous tricks, including magic with strings, gloves, eggs, rice and some utility devices. The penultimate chapter describes large stage illusions, and the final chapter contains advice on routining a magic show, and more advice on staging.</p>
                <p>Its popularity is due in part to the scarcity of teaching materials available to would-be magicians in the late 19th Century.[4] Modern Magic was the first book in the English language to really explain how to perform magical feats.</p>
                <p>Finally, probably  the most important fact of magic in the 1800s is the beggining of Hary Houdini's carrer.</p>
                <p>The escapologist and magician <a href="">Harry Houdini</a> took his stage name from Robert-Houdin and developed a range of stage magic tricks, many of them based on what became known after his death as escapology. Houdini was genuinely skilled in techniques such as lockpicking and escaping straitjackets, but also made full use of the range of conjuring techniques, including fake equipment and collusion with individuals in the audience. Houdini's show business savvy was as great as his performance skill. </p>
