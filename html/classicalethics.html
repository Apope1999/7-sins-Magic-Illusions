            <h2>Do not openly expose magic</h2>
            There is no such thing as magic if the secrets would be out in the open. Selling magic or teaching it privately to other magicians and assistants is fine, as well as publicly exposing your own creations which use nothing but original principles and mechanics. You may not expose other people's effects without their permission.
            <h2>Do not perform a trick more than once for the same people</h2>
            <p>Repeating a trick, illusion or routine for the same people means that you are turning a magical experience into a puzzle or challenge and are giving the audience a chance to figure out how the trick in question is done.</p>
            <h2>Do not steal material</h2>
            You are free to perform anything you know with the exception of unpublished material from living magicians and creators or material involving active performance rights unless you have obtained permission to do so. When the magician or creator in question has passed away and there are no active performance rights in play, you can freely perform and teach the effect as long as you credit the creator.
            <h2>Give credits where credits are due</h2>
            Credits need to be given in products and lectures. It also means that you cannot blatantly take and rename effects and routines. In case the original name involves a specific prop and you happen to use something else in your performance, you can change the name so that it would suit your take. In case the original version differs from yours from a mechanical point of view, you can rename it as well, but you will still need to give credits to the original creator if you did base it on this person's idea.

            Credits usually include the creators of the trick, routine and included techniques. Techniques without any known creator could be skipped. In case it is a fully independent creation, you are allowed to say just that, although doing some research is much more appreciated. If research has been done and it still appears to be an original creation, there is nothing wrong by giving credits to yourself. However, if an earlier publication has been overlooked, a correction of some sort needs to be made.
            <h2>Make everything you do your own</h2>
            There is no need to try to copy other magicians or their acts. Be yourself and tweak effects to make them suit your own style and ways of handling props instead of that of anyone else.
            <h2>Put time and effort into anything you perform</h2>
            Be sure to treat every effect with respect and to put in the time you need to get it down and perform it well. Spectators are not supposed to see what is going on behind the scenes.
            <h2>There is no pride in figuring out effects, only in performing them</h2>
            Do not be openly proud if you have figured out the secret to an effect, only be proud if you are able to perform it well by yourself. Blatantly saying you have figured out how a performer did a trick is not respectful in any way.
            <h2>Do not be a know-it-all</h2>
            Use your knowledge and experience to help whoever needs it, but do not use it as an argument that you are always correct. The most experienced magicians may be the easiest to fool and the fastest to overlook anything.
            <h2>Treat products with respect</h2>
            Re-selling, trading or giving away products means that you cannot make copies of them, with the exception of products that are in the public domain. In case you want to have or make multiple copies of a product to share with others, you will either have to purchase the item as many times as the amount of copies you will end up with or obtain permission from the copyright owner.

            It is okay to make copies for personal use, like writing notes from a book into your notepad or copying a product when the original starts falling apart.
