                        <p>Robert was born on December 7, 1805 in Blois, France. His father - Prosper Robert - was one of the best watchmaking masters in the city. Prosper used his unique talent and incredible diligence to provide his family with a dignified existence. All his life he dreamed of his children becoming the truly respected members of a society.</p>
                        <p>When Jean became 11 years old, at the behest of his father, he went to a school at the University of Orléans, which was located in 35 miles away from his city. At the age of 18, Jean successfully completed his studies and returned to Blois. His father wanted him to become a lawyer, but Robert himself was more attracted by the work of a watchmaker.</p>
                        <p>An excellent handwriting helped Jean to obtain a clerk's place in the office of the local solicitor. However, instead of studying law, Robert spent time tinkering with mechanical devices. When he lost his job, he finally managed to confess to his father about the dreams of becoming a watchmaker. By that time, Prosper had already retired, so Jean became an apprentice to his cousin who was engaged in a family shop. However, due to the talent, pretty quickly Robert managed to become an independent watchmaker.</p>
                        <p>At 1820-s, Jean managed to save money for a two-volume book on the clock subject called: “Traité de l'horlogerie”, by Ferdinand Berthoud. In the bookshop, however, he was mistakenly given a two-volume of “Scientific Amusements”, which was about the art of showing tricks. Jean did not return the books - curiosity prevailed. Very soon he realized that he had found his new vocation. Volumes contained no revelations regarding the art of illusion, but the interest awakened by them made Robert to start his independent research. Jean went to a local magician and began taking lessons. Maous, a magician from Blois, taught the guy a number of very useful things - in particular, juggling. The inherent dexterity and accuracy of Robert after regular exercises developed even more.</p>
                        <p>Magic for a long time remained only a hobby of Jean, because he earned his living as a watchmaker. After a while, Robert moved to the Tours. There Jean became an amateur actor in a troupe. Later he managed to hone his professional skills even more by showing tricks at high society parties. It was on one of these performances when he got acquainted with Joséphae Cecile Houdin, a daughter of a Parisian watchmaker -Jacques François Houdin. Joseph and Jean were married on July 8, 1830, after which a young conjurer added her surname to his last name.</p>
                        <p>When they moved to Paris, Jean got a job in a father-in-law's shop. Jacques Francois was one of the last watchmakers of the “old school” style, whose clocks were exclusively handmade. The son-in-law's love for fine mechanics pleased him very much. Robert-Houdin began creating new types of mechanical toys, such as singing birds and miniature rope-walkers. One of his best creations was a machine that knew how to write and draw. Even King Louis Philippe got interested in Jean’s inventions. But he did not abandon magic. On the contrary, on one of the streets of Paris he accidentally found a shop for magicians. There he acquired a number of very useful connections and many interesting tricks.</p>
                        <p>In 1843, after a long illness, the wife of Robert-Houdin died, leaving three children for their father’s guardianship. Trying to at least partially relieve this situation, Jean married again. His second wife soon took the whole household into her own hands.</p>
                        <p>The magician continued to perform at private parties and designing sophisticated devices for advanced tricks. At that time he had a dream of his own theater, which became true by the assistance of Count de l'Escalopier, who hired the magician for a series of parties and paid 15000 francs for it. Robert-Houdin rented several rooms at the royal palace and converted them into a theater.</p>
                        <p>The first performance was given on July 3, 1845 and was unsuccessful. Staying on the very verge of a nervous breakdown, magician closed the theater. Only after one of his acquaintances encouragement, he managed to resume performances.</p>
                        <p>Gradually, Jean got used to the stage. Critics began to devote more and more positive reviews. His mechanical toys were compared to the creations of real legends of the world of tricks like Philippe and Bosco. Unfortunately, the theater's income was very unstable. However, Robert did not lose hope and gradually managed to win the interest of the whole city. His renovated theater was illuminated with electricity and could boast with a number of cunning mechanical devices.</p>
                        <p>After retiring from a career of a magician, Jean decided to become an inventor, as his experiments with electricity were much ahead of his time.</p>
                        <p>In 1856, Louis-Napoleon asked Robert to go to Algeria to assist in pacifying local wild tribes. The conjurer brilliantly coped with the task and then gave his last performance in Marseille and returned home to Saint-Gervais.</p>
                        <p>On August 6, 1870, Jean learned that his son was mortally wounded in the Battle of Worth. The death of his son had a vastly bad impact on the sorcerer’s health. On June 13, 1871, Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin passed away.</p>
