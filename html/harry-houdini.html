                        <p>Harry Houdini, was born as Ehrich Weiss in Budapest, Hungary, on March 24, 1874. He was the fourth boy in a family of Mayer Samuel Weiss and Cecilia Steiner. They were earning money by providing rabbinical lawyer services and making soap. When he was four years old his family moved to the United States, where they lived in Wisconsin. At the age of ten, he was showing tricks in public places, using cards. When Erie was 13, the family moved to New York City. There, at the age of 18, he assigned himself a pseudonym Houdini. This name was not chosen in honor of the French magician, <a href="jean-robert-houdin.html">Jean Robert Houdin</a>, whose last name had a similar pronunciation. Name Harry was added later.</p>
                        <p>Life in New York was not easy. His father died early, leaving them  without a breadwinner. It was necessary to work to feed the family. Harry worked as a blacksmith assistant, where learnt an important future skill of lock picking, as an acrobat in the circus and, at the same time, was engaged by his hobby - magic and tricks. Due to the money shortage, education was an inadmissible luxury, so mother was teaching children how to read and write.</p>
                        <p>As aforementioned earlier, even at the age of ten Harry was able to attract attention of the public. He performed with his brother in the ensemble called "The Houdini Brothers". The earnings from the successful performances allowed them to feed the whole family. Inspired by the success, boys continued to give concerts around the city and, after growing up a bit, began to travel around the nearby towns. Their posters hung around the whole city. But to hold and amaze the audience young magician was always up for new and interesting tricks.</p>
                        <p>At one of the concerts an incident that has become a golden ticket to the big stage occurred. One day, while conducting a show in one small town, a local policeman took an illusionist for a wanted thief. He came on a stage and put on the handcuffs on Harry. In less than 5 minutes, the handcuffs were removed, and the guard of order apologized for the inconvenience. Soon a focus with handcuffs became the main part of the show. Moreover, unlike all other handcuff performances, Harry practiced it with handcuffs given by the crowd. In 1899, Martin Beck, an entertainment manager, saw a huge potential in the magician and his tricks. Trips to different cities in Europe began soon.</p>
                        <p>The show was also spiced by the local police, which was arresting an illusionist and even shutting him in a prison. However, he was able to escape from anywhere, which helped him to become the highest paid artist in the realm of American magicians.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, an aging process has no mercy, so as the time passed, it became increasingly difficult for Harry to do his tricks, which several times have even led him to the hospital. In 1910 he started a movie career. For his roles Harry received fabulous amounts of money and there are still some rumors that his salary was twice as big as the president's. While being a wealthy man, Houdini still continued to count every cent, afraid to die in poverty as his father. Also he sacrificed huge sums to the old, poor and orphaned. His wife was Bess Houdini.</p>
                        <p>The death of the great magician came unexpectedly. One day some students entered his dressing room. They asked the magician whether he can really withstand kicks to the stomach and not feel pain. Houdini mechanically nodded and one of the guys crashed down a series of strikes on the magician’s stomach. As a result, Houdini’s appendicitis ruptured. Medicine these days was far from modern and Houdini died of peritonitis on the October 31, 1926 in Detroit, Michigan, America at the age of 52.</p>
