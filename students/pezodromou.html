            <h1>Pezodromou Apostolos</h1>
            <p>My name is Apostolos Pezodromou and I love computer science! I always wanted to be a game developer since this is my biggest hobby! I have other hobbies too such as playing tennis, listening to music and watching series and animes.</p>
            <h2>Tennis</h2>
            <p>Tennis is a sport that I used to play often. What I like about tennis is that is trains every aspect of one's body. Both mentally and physically.</p>
            <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91ctKvK64YL._SL1500_.jpg" alt="Tennis racket" style="width: 35%">
            <h2>Gaming</h2>
            <p>So gaming is my main hobby. I game for more than a decade and my first ever system was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Micro">Game Boy Micro</a> which I still own in a working condition to this day.</p>
            <p>My favorite kinds of games are the ones who have a nice story and that let you "chose your own path" per say.</p>
            <h2>Series &amp; Anime</h2>
            <p>In my free time when I am not gaming I will probably be watching some kinds of series or anime. Most likely an anime. 
            </p>
            <p>In case you are wondering which series I am currently watching right now you can check out my <a href="https://myanimelist.net/profile/Apope1999">MyAnimeList</a> profile.</p>
